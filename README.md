# Rio-Way-Beach-Hotel

<h2>Overvieww</h2>

Welcome to the README for the Rio Surf Haven website! This project represents a personal endeavor where I designed and coded the homepage of a responsive website for a surf-themed hotel/pousada located in Rio de Janeiro. This site is my first fully coded project, completed approximately a year ago, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The absence of frameworks or content management systems (CMS) underscores the project‚Äôs authenticity and serves as a testament to my coding skills and growth over the past year.

<h2>Features</h2>

<strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The homepage is designed to be accessible and user-friendly across various platforms, ensuring a seamless experience for users on different devices, from desktops to smartphones.

<strong>Location:</strong> The homepage is dedicated to promoting and providing information about a surf-themed hotel/pousada situated in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro. Users can explore details about the accommodation, amenities, and the unique surf experience offered by the establishment.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong> The project is primarily built using HTML for the structure of the homepage, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. No external frameworks or CMS were employed, emphasizing a hand-coded approach.

Getting Started To view the homepage, simply open the ‚Äòindex.html‚Äô file in your preferred web browser. The absence of external dependencies ensures a straightforward setup process.
